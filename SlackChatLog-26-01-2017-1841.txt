[18:41]<Anzekay> so I think we can just use this for the jam
[18:41]<Anzekay> with you two off sick and all
[18:41]<GameDad> Wow, someone actually made a neural net that can do this?
[18:42]<Anzekay> I can do some language stuff with it since I’m on site
[18:42]<Anzekay> make it feel authentic
[18:43]<Ninjeska> Is this any easier than doing it ourselves
[18:44]<Anzekay> well
[18:44]<Anzekay> the idea is that we just feed it info
[18:44]<Anzekay> like some unity tutorials
[18:43]<Anzekay> video guides etc
[18:45]<Anzekay> and then it just makes something
[18:45]<GameDad> It would be pretty fascinating to see what it makes..
[18:46]<Anzekay> I’m game if you both are
[18:48]<Ninjeska> Sure, I am intrigued. 
[18:49]<GameDad> I’m willing to give it a shot!
[18:51]<Anzekay> if it doesn’t work out we can use you two being sick as an excuse :p
